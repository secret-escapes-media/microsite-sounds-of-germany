  - id: ko-bogen-ii-und-konigsallee
    title: Kö-Bogen II and Königsallee
    content: "This popular square and tourist attraction  was redesigned by the renowned Düsseldorf architectural firm Ingenhoven, known for its sustainable projects. The area is covered in 8 kilometers of hornbeam hedge, resulting in Europe’s largest green facade.  Kö Bogen (by Libeskind) and the Kö Bogen II (by Ingenhoven architects) together are a perfect place for visitors who are attracted not only by the sustainable architecture but also by the outstanding shopping facilities. The Königsallee is a street lined with some of the most prestigious retailers and exclusive malls, with jewellers and high-end street cafes. In the middle of the boulevard is the Kö-Graben, a canal of the Düssel, whose embankments invite you to linger in the shade of large chestnut and sycamore trees."

    title: Tonhalle
    content: "Architect Wilhelm Kreis, who also designed the adjacent Ehrenhof, originally designed the Tonhalle as a planetarium in 1925. About 50 years after its opening, the neoclassical dome building was given a new lease of life and became a concert hall for performances of all genres including classical, jazz, chanson,  soul, piano and cabaret. In 2005, the hall was modernised and the acoustics were improved for the enjoyment of not only the Düsseldorf Symphonic orchestra, but also the 300,000 or more culture fans, who visit the 450 events every year."

    title: Little Tokyo
    content: "Düsseldorf is home to the largest Japanese community in Germany. Nearly 8,000 Japanese people live in the state capital and characterise the vibrant area Little Tokyo. Anyone who longs for the dynamic nature of Asian cities will find it here. Superb restaurants and izakayas (Japanese pubs) serve authentic Japanese cuisine. Locals, Japanese business people, young manga fans and foodies from all over the world come together here to enjoy ramen, sushi, sake and Altbier. Japanese culture is not only to be found in Little Tokyo. You can also stroll through the Japanese Garden in the Nordpark to the EKŌ-Haus in Düsseldorf-Niederkassel, where you can marvel at the Buddhist temple."

    title: Europe’s densest cultural region
    content: "World-class mu­seums and out­stand­ing con­cert halls are just a few of the reasons to visit the culturally diverse North Rhine-Westphalia. Whichever city you explore in the region, you’ll be presented with a vast range of cultural and historical experiences. One famed for its historic background is Bonn, the old capital city and birthplace of Beethoven. Today visitors can follow in his footsteps and see through their own eyes the composer’s birthplace, which is now a museum. The museum takes guests back to the 18th century and offers deeper insights into the life and work of the great composer. The museum houses the largest Beethoven collection in the world, depicting his life and work. For a more contemporary cultural experience, head to the Bundeskunsthalle; a space for promoting liv­ing cul­ture and cul­tur­al ex­change. These are just the tip of the iceberg in Europe’s densest cultural region."

    title: From half-timbered to cosmopolitan
    content: "If culture, history and architecture is what you’re after, North Rhine-Westphalia provides it in abundance. From the spa city of Aachen, known for its hot springs, to the historic city of Bielefeld, the largest in the Teuto­burg Forest. For cycling enthusiasts, pedal straight to the historically rich city of Münster. Voted one of the world’s most livable cities, this is metropolitan life as it should be. Whether by bike or on foot, the first stop in discovering the city’s 1200-year old history has to be the Old Town. The square around St Paul’s Cathedral tells the history of the city’s creation, while the gabled houses in the Prinzipalmarkt shed light on the medieval merchant past. The creative heart of the city beats in the city's harbour, with a thriving art scene, bars and agencies that live nearby."

    title: Prost! Enjoy the Rhenish way of life
    content: "North Rhine-Westphalia is known for its delicious,  authentic food & drink. Here, beer is a way of life, with the classic Kölsch, a pale, top-fermented brew firmly ranking alongside Cologne Cathedral as a symbol of the city. Today, over 25 different Kölsch brands are brewing their own versions of this refreshing tipple. For those who like to go against the grain, many regional cities have their own styles of beer, such as the pale “Eifeler Landbier”. After all that beer, you’ll likely be in need of something to soak up the alcohol and you’re in luck. Pep­pery beef stew, a pot-baked potato dish and “Heav­en and Earth” (mashed potato with black pudding and apple compote) are just a few of the au­then­t­ic re­gion­al spe­ci­al­it­ies you should try.
