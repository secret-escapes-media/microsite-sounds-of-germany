    title: "Funkturm: Berlin radio tower"
    content: Reopening this September following renovations, the striking Funkturm tower stands in the middle of the historical exhibition halls and offers spectacular panoramic views of the city. For those who prefer to extend their experience at the top, you can dine at the elegant restaurant that is suspended over the city. A delightful historical anecdote is that in 1930, one of the world’s most famous physicists, Albert Einstein stood at the foot of the steel structure and held the opening speech for the 7th German Radio Exhibition.

    title: KulturBrauerei Berlin
    content: Once the site of a brewery, the KulturBrauerei is now the go-to destination in Berlin for culture and activities. Vats and barrels have been replaced by a cinema, clubs, a museum and restaurants. The area consists of six courtyards each with their own hidden treasures, like The Frannz Club which is  not only a club, but also a restaurant, beer garden and lounge. Be sure to check out the food market that  arrives every Sunday. Prefer to explore on your own set of wheels? Hire a bicycle from Berlin on Bike making it easy to explore the area and wider city.

    title: German Museum of Technology
    content: Railway enthusiasts will love the “Anhalter”, which opened in 1841 and was once one of Berlin’s largest and most important railway stations. Even today old steam locomotives occupy the Anhalter depot’s historic engine sheds, belonging to the German Museum of Technology. The museum opened in 1983 and has continually expanded until what is now one of Europe’s greatest technology museums.

    title: Ullsteinhaus
    content: Once the buzzing media hub of Berlin, the Ullsteinhaus was Germany's largest and most modern newspaper printing house. This impressive expressionist building now acts as a beacon for a lively artistic hub with bars for the reveler and inviting sun terraces for the leisure captains. The core of the building is a steel skeleton structure and the walls are cast in concrete. At the time of construction, it was the first of its kind in Germany, and its silhouette still dominates the skyline of the  urban harbor area today where you will find a wide range of shopping and restaurant facilities.

    title: KPM Berlin - Royal Porcelain Factory
    content: The Royal Porcelain Factory, or KPM as it has come to be known, is a 250-year-old factory that was and still is the site where high-quality porcelain is made by hand. The beautiful items make the perfect gifts from your travels to Berlin. The stamp of the royal sceptre brand stands for quality craftsmanship and is recognised all over the world. Experience the fascinating KPM brands and products in the interactive exhibition and café, and you can even paint your own souvenir.


  - id: borsigwerke
    title: Borsigwerke
    content: Love architecture and history? You’ll find plenty of both in the district of Reinickendorf. The “Hallen am Borsigturm” feature historical buildings interspersed with modern architecture. The Borsighallen is now home to a thriving shopping mall but was once the site of the production halls for the locomotives. The gate of the former engineering works, which opened in the 19th century, is a must-see. Go right up to the end of the street called Am Borsigturm - it’s worth it! Nearby Lake Tegel is within walking distance for those who’d like to extend their visit, and also take a trip to the old city centre (in the old district of Tegel).
