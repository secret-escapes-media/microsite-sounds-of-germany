    content: Reopening this September following renovations, the striking Funkturm tower offers panoramic views of the city. In 1926 it was opened in time for the 3rd German Radio Exhibition. The world’s first television picture was broadcast here that  same year. The next première was in 1929 with the first radio transmissions. In 1930, one of the world’s most famous physicists, Albert Einstein stood at the foot of the steel structure and held the opening speech for the 7th German Radio Exhibition.

    title: Ullsteinhaus
    content: Once the buzzing media hub of Berlin, the Ullsteinhaus was Germany's largest and most modern newspaper printing house. This impressive expressionist building now acts as a beacon for a lively artistic hub with bars for the reveler and inviting sun terraces for the leisure captains. The core of the building is a steel skeleton structure and the walls are cast in concrete. At the time of construction, it was the first of its kind in Germany, and its silhouette still dominates the skyline of the  urban harbor area today.

    title: Borsigwerke
    content: Love architecture and history? You’ll find plenty of both in Reinickendorf. The “Hallen am Borsigturm” feature historical buildings interspersed with modern architecture. The gate of the former engineering works, which opened in the 19th century, is a must-see. Back then, the halls of the Borsigwerke primarily manufactured locomotives and were the biggest manufacturer in Europe and the second-biggest in the world. The Borsigturm on the site, which is the most famous landmark of the Borsigwerke, was used as a water tower and office building. August Borsig also worked on the fountains at Sanssouci, the dome of the Nikolaikirche in Potsdam and the Stadtschloss in Berlin. Go right up to the end of the street called Am Borsigturm - it’s worth it!
