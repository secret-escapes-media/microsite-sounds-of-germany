    title: Gewandhaus Concert Hall
    content: The Gewandhaus concert hall has gained considerable international renown as the home of the famous Gewandhaus Orchestra. Around half a million music lovers from all over the world come to see one of the world’s leading symphony orchestras every year. Merchants from Leipzig founded the orchestra back in 1743, making it one of  Europe’s oldest civilian concert orchestras. Its legendary fame is supported by its musical directors, which include Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Kurt Masur, Herbert Blomstedt, Riccardo Chailly and today Andris Nelsons.

    title: St. Thomas Church
    content: The ethereal church of St. Thomas was originally built as a monastery in 1212 giving us insight into over 800 years of history. Between 1723 and 1750,  Johann Sebastian Bach worked as the Choirmaster in Leipzig; during this time, he led the St. Thomas Choir. In recognition, the St. Thomas Boys Choir sings Bach’s motets & cantatas here every Friday/Saturday, and it is the epicentre  of the annual Bachfest which is held in June. There are also special performances of Bach’s St. John Passion at Easter, and the Christmas Oratorio in December. Most of Bach’s works were written here, and the church is also Bach's final resting place which is why it is regarded as an important centre of classical music the world over.

    title: Leipzig Opera
    content: Founded in 1693, the Leipzig Opera is the third-oldest civic musical theatre in Europe. It is the performance space of the Leipzig Ballet, which carries  international esteem, and where the Gewandhaus orchestra accompanies all opera house performances. General music director Prof. Ulf Schirmer has strengthened the opera’s profile with performances of Leipzig’s own Richard Wagner. Wagner’s music is celebrated throughout the year with events such as Wagner Weekends and Wagner 22 Festival. Leipzig Opera House is considered a gem of the architectural history of the late 1950s.

    title: St. Nicholas Church
    content: A poignant building for many reasons, St. Nicholas’s Church dates back over 850 years. Three key dates that this church played a central role in include the first official Protestant church service in Leipzig in 1539 (the start of the Reformation), and in 1723 Johann Sebastian Bach took office as the Director of Music for the city of Leipzig premiering much of his work before the congregation. In more recent history, St. Nicholas Church became the site for the peace prayers after the 1989 peaceful uprising that led to the collapse of the socialist regime. Some 70,000 took to the streets on October 9th  1989 to demonstrate for freedom of speech, assembly and travel. Chants such as “We are the people!” and “No violence!” heralded the Peaceful Revolution in Germany.

    title: Spinnerei Galleries
    content: Once a buzzing factory town, home to the biggest cotton-spinning mill in continental Europe, this industrial area has now become a poignant scene for budding artists. By 2004, the Spinnerei had become well known as a centre for artistic production and it had succeeded in attracting the attention of Leipzig’s gallery scene. In 2005, six Leipzig galleries opened new exhibitions in the Spinnerei. Today the Spinnerei is home to 14 galleries and exhibitions. Today, the Spinnerei is an authentic, historic factory complex whose soul is its many creative inhabitants and the contemporary content which they bring to it.

    content: Leipzig’s most famous landmark is located close to Napoleon’s former command post in the centre of the battlefield of the Battle of the Nations in 1813. The monument is a towering 91 metres high. Its viewing platform provides a stunning panoramic view of Leipzig and its surroundings. The highlights of a visit to the Monument can include concert events – distinguished by the highly favourable acoustic conditions.
