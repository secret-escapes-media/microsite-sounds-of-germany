overview-intro: The unofficial German capital of classical music.

intro: "Leipzig has to be the unofficial German capital of classical music. It was here that legendary composer Bach wrote many of his works, and directed the St. Thomas Boys choir at the eponymous church - his final resting place. Want to immerse yourself in live music? The Gewandhaus concert hall is the home of the infamous orchestra - taking in a live performance is an experience not to be missed. If all that wasn’t enough, then the Leipzig Opera completes the trifecta of musical splendour on offer in Leipzig."

    content: "The Gewandhaus concert hall has gained considerable international renown as the home of the famous Gewandhaus Orchestra. Around half a million music lovers from all over the world come to see one of the world’s leading symphony orchestras every year. Merchants from Leipzig founded the orchestra back in 1743, making it one of  Europe’s oldest civilian concert orchestras. Its legendary fame is supported by its musical directors, which include Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Kurt Masur, Herbert Blomstedt, Riccardo Chailly and today Andris Nelsons. A perfect time to visit will be during the Mahler Festival from 13-24th May 2021, which offers a unique programme to hear all of Mahler's symphonies and other orchestral works which will be interpreted by ten world-class orchestras."

    title: St. Thomas Church
    content: "The ethereal church of St. Thomas was originally built as a monastery in 1212 giving us insight into over 800 years of history. Between 1723 and 1750,  Johann Sebastian Bach worked as the Choirmaster in Leipzig; during this time, he led the St. Thomas Choir. In recognition, the St. Thomas Boys Choir sings Bach’s motets & cantatas here every Friday/Saturday, and it is the epicentre  of the annual Bachfest which is held in June. There are also special performances of Bach’s St. John Passion at Easter, and the Christmas Oratorio in December. Most of Bach’s works were written here, and the church is also Bach's final resting place which is why it is regarded as an important centre of classical music the world over. "

Each performance is accompanied by the world-class Gewandhaus Orchestra, doubling the musical delight. It is the performance space of the Leipzig Ballet, which carries international esteem, and where the Gewandhaus orchestra accompanies all opera house performances. General music director Prof. Ulf Schirmer has strengthened the Opera’s profile with performances of Leipzig’s own Richard Wagner. Wagner’s music is celebrated throughout the year with events such as Wagner Weekends and two complete Ring cycle performances. In 2022, a unique Richard Wagner festival will present all 13 Wagner operas over  three weeks. "

    title: St. Nicholas Church
    content: A poignant building for many reasons, St. Nicholas’s Church dates back over 850 years. Three key dates that this church played a central role in include the first official Protestant church service in Leipzig in 1539 (the start of the Reformation), and in 1723 Johann Sebastian Bach took office as the Director of Music for the city of Leipzig premiering much of his work before the congregation. In more recent history, St. Nicholas Church became the site for the peace prayers after the 1989 peaceful uprising that led to the collapse of the socialist regime. Some 70,000 took to the streets on October 9th  1989 to demonstrate for freedom of speech, assembly and travel. Chants such as “We are the people!” and “No violence!” heralded the Peaceful Revolution in Germany.

    content: Once a buzzing factory town, home to the biggest cotton-spinning mill in continental Europe, this industrial area has now become a poignant scene for budding artists. By 2004, the Spinnerei had become well known as a centre for artistic production and it had succeeded in attracting the attention of Leipzig’s gallery scene. Today the Spinnerei is home to 14 galleries and exhibitions. It is an authentic, historic factory complex whose soul is its many creative inhabitants and the contemporary content which they bring to it.
